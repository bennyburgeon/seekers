Some thoughts.

from user levels - lead to CMS 
from CMS - Blog - Lead to CRM or any other projects, so that they buy more than one project, instead of giving single projects
single projects can be from expertguidelines.com or from planmyprojects.com which may lead to new PMS app. 
finally go with eazy development.com
PLan to sell Property CRM and gradually send all other projects. instead of open marketing.
